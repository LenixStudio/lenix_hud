# Auto Build Setup

## Setup (One Time)

```bash
npm install javascript-obfuscator terser
```

## Build

```bash
node build.js
```

## What It Does

Automatically finds all `.js` files and creates minified + obfuscated versions in `build/` folders next to each file.

**Example:**
```
main.js → build/main.js
web/script.js → web/build/script.js
```

That's it! ✨
